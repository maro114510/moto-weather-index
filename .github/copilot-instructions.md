# Copilot Instructions

Follow `AGENTS.md` as the primary repository instruction.

Additional rules for Copilot:
- Keep edits minimal and task-focused.
- Prefer existing project patterns over introducing new abstractions.
- Validate changes with `task lint` and `task test` before marking a task complete.
